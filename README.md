# Classification Model for Predicting Target Variable

This code implements a classification model for predicting a target variable based on a given dataset. It follows a standard machine learning pipeline, including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction on new data.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Loading**: The code begins by loading the training and test datasets from `train.csv` and `test.csv` files, respectively. It utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset. The code visualizes the distribution of the target variable, checks the correlation between features, and handles missing values and outliers.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: This section focuses on preparing the data for model training. Missing values are filled with appropriate strategies (e.g., mean imputation), outliers are handled using statistical techniques (e.g., Z-score method), and feature scaling is applied to normalize numerical features.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The code trains multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Each model is evaluated using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

5. **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Another section is dedicated to selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics. The models are trained on the training set and evaluated on a validation set.

6. **Making Predictions**: The chosen model is then used to make predictions on the test set. The test set is preprocessed in a similar manner as the training set, including handling missing values and performing one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

7. **Creating Submission File**: Finally, the predicted target variable for the test set is saved in a submission file (`submission.csv`), following the required format for submission.

## Dependencies

The code relies on the following libraries:

- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Used for numerical operations.
- Scikit-learn: Used for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization.

Make sure to have these libraries installed before running the code.

## Usage

To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the required dependencies are installed.
2. Download the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files containing the dataset.
3. Run the code in a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
4. The code will perform data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
5. The predicted target variable for the test set will be saved in `submission.csv`.

Please note that the code assumes the dataset is in a specific format and may need modifications to fit different datasets.
